### Exercise 1: Diskspd

**Step 1: Download Diskspd**

- Create the folder **C:\Diskspd**
- Download **Diskspd.exe** from **https://github.com/roblevay/T1987** to the folder **C:\Diskspd**

**Step 2: Run Diskspd**

- Start a command prompt as Administrator
- Run the command **C:\diskspd\Diskspd.exe -b8K -d20 -h -L -o2 -t4 -r -w30 -c50M c:\diskspd\io.dat**

## Explanation of Parameters

- **`-b8K`**  
  Sets the block size used for I/O operations.  
  *Here: 8 KB per operation.*

- **`-d20`**  
  Specifies the test duration in seconds.  
  *Here: The test runs for 20 seconds.*

- **`-h`**  
  Enables *hardware write caching bypass*.  
  This means data is written directly to disk, bypassing the OS cache.

- **`-L`**  
  Enables latency measurements to collect statistics on I/O delays.

- **`-o2`**  
  Sets the number of outstanding I/O operations (Queue Depth).  
  *Here: 2 concurrent operations per thread.*

- **`-t4`**  
  Specifies the number of threads used for the test.  
  *Here: 4 threads.*

- **`-r`**  
  Configures the test to use random access instead of sequential access.

- **`-w30`**  
  Sets the write percentage in a mixed read/write workload.  
  *Here: 30% writes, 70% reads.*

- **`-c50M`**  
  Creates a 50 MB test file for the benchmark.

- **`c:\diskspd\io.dat`**  
  The file used to run the test.

# Exercise 2: Interpret DiskSpd

## Executive Summary
The test sustained about **4,000 IOPS** with a throughput of ~31.5 MiB/s.  
Average latency was low (1‚Äì3 ms), but there were **occasional spikes up to 50 ms**.  
This indicates solid performance for typical workloads, with some variability in tail latency.

# Exercise 2: Interpret DiskSpd

## Executive Summary
The test shows about **4,000 IOPS** and **~31 MB/s throughput**.  
Average latency is low (1‚Äì3 ms), but there are **occasional spikes up to ~50 ms**.  
This means the disk performs well for mixed workloads, but has some outliers that can affect very latency-sensitive applications.

---

## Step 1: Test Setup
- **Duration:** ~20 seconds  
- **Threads:** 4  
- **Workload:** Random 8 KB operations, 30% writes / 70% reads  
- **Test file:** 50 MB  

üëâ This is a short stress test simulating a database-like workload.

---

## Step 2: CPU Usage
```

avg. CPU usage: \~4% (mostly idle)

```
- CPU usage is very low ‚Üí the test is **limited by disk speed**, not by processor power.  
- This is expected in an I/O benchmark.

---

## Step 3: Total I/O
```

Throughput: \~31.5 MiB/s
IOPS: \~4,033 per second
Average latency: \~2 ms

```
- **Throughput** is how much data was read/written per second.  
- **IOPS** is how many individual operations were completed per second.  
- **Latency** shows how long each operation took on average.  
- Result: The disk handles ~4,000 small I/Os every second, each taking ~2 ms.

---

## Step 4: Read I/O
```

Throughput: \~22 MiB/s
IOPS: \~2,824 / sec
Avg latency: \~1.7 ms

```
- Reads are **fast and efficient**.  
- Latency is lower than writes, which is typical.

---

## Step 5: Write I/O
```

Throughput: \~9.5 MiB/s
IOPS: \~1,210 / sec
Avg latency: \~2.5 ms

```
- Writes are **slower and more variable** than reads.  
- This matches most storage behavior: writes are harder work for disks.

---

## Step 6: Latency Distribution
```

Median (50th percentile): 0.2‚Äì1 ms
95th percentile: 0.5 ms (reads), 2.7 ms (writes)
99th percentile: 37‚Äì38 ms
Max: \~55 ms

```
- **Most operations are very quick** (well under 1 ms).  
- **Some operations take much longer** (tens of ms).  
- These rare outliers are called **tail latency** and may cause slow responses in sensitive systems.

---

## Final Interpretation
- The disk is capable of **~4,000 small random I/Os per second** with low average latency.  
- **Reads are faster** than writes, as expected.  
- **Occasional long delays** show up in the 99th percentile ‚Üí this is normal but important if you need very predictable performance.  
- Overall: **Good performance for general workloads**, but not perfectly consistent.
